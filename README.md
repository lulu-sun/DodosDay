# DodosDay

This game was developed over the course of approximately 2 months. It is built in Unity and C#. I used object orienting programming concepts to build a game controller, a player controller, and multiple event tracking controllers. Because there were a lot of interactive elements and mini-games within the main game, it was vital to design a good system for handling and synchronizing game progression.

Because I was building the game for someone else, it had a set delivery date. I acted as both the lead developer and the project manager. I crafted a progress timeline for this project, and managed communication with all of the other outside input I would require for specific elements of the game.
